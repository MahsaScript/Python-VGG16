# Python-VGG16![vgg16-accuracy]
VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database [1]. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.
